The goal of baltimoreCIP is to combine legacy reports and spatial data for the Baltimore City Capital Improvement Program into a tidy data source for internal and public use.

This project is organized around three main folders:

- `files`: Required files including Microsoft Excel and PDF reports downloaded from the Baltimore City Department of Planning website. Organized into sub-folder (`agency`, `budget`, and `program`) based on report type.
- `R`: Scripts and functions for processing the files into a tidy data format.
- `data`: Output data including a combined CSV file for the 2014-2024 reports, a GeoJSON file with the locations associated with that same period, and a CSV file for the 2008-2013 reports.

For questions, please contact Eli Pousson, Data Lead with the Baltimore City Department of Planning, at eli.pousson@baltimorecity.gov{.email}.
